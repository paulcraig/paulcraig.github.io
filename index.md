# Suggested Reading

About 9 years ago, I moved into a leadership role on my campus. I knew very little about leadership, so I started to read as much as I could based on recommendations from friends, colleagues, and the annual Global Leadership Summit.

The reading has also included a lot of nonfiction about effective communication, finance, understanding how people think, learning how to work more effectively, and learning how to understand information as it is presented.

The books are organized into several categories. Each linked files contains links to TED talks or similar presentations, the Amazon site to purchase the book, some reviews and my thoughts.
