# Suggested Reading

About 9 years ago, I moved into a leadership role on my campus. I knew very little about leadership, so I started to read as much as I could based on recommendations from friends, colleagues, and the annual Global Leadership Summit.

The reading has also included a lot of nonfiction about effective communication, finance, understanding how people think, learning how to work more effectively, and learning how to understand information as it is presented.

The books are organized into the following categories:

* communication
* leadership
* finance
* organizations
* personal success
